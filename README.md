# PICO-8 API

> Due to some other projects, its been a while since I updated this, but I will be posting a massive update soon! Lot's of previously undiscovered shortcuts, a new tricks to add to the arsenal! - **iivii** `12/16/2020`

*Updated* & unofficial [PICO-8 API](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=manual) with a lovely design !

## What is PICO-8 ?

PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua commands and provides simple built-in tools for creating your own cartridges.

PICO-8 is made by [Lexaloffle](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

## Version Information

+ The current Pico-8 version is : `0.2.1b`
+ The current API version is: `0.2.0` _and only partially complete_

There were formatting changes that needed to take precedence before I could get to the new stuff, and a lot of missed information that needed to be added. Then, after nearly completing updates to the API, a literal rampage of updates were added to Pico-8, something [@zep](https://twitter.com/lexaloffle) has never done before. So, I had a lot to do, and I do this in my spare time - so I'm doing my best to keep this relevant and current! 

I've taken notes on all the new things, and am really exploring the IDE like never before. Besides just updating my own API that I use to keep track of everything, I've uncovered multiple keyboard shortcuts that as far as I know, have **never been mentioned** and they will be added to the list soon!
