PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua commands and provides simple built-in tools for creating your own cartridges.

PICO-8 is made by [Lexaloffle](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
